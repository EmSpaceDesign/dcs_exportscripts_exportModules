# dcs_exportscripts_exportModules
Custom ExportModules for the DCS World ExportScripts plugin by s-d-a for Eagle Dynamic's DCS World.

# Introduction
## Purpose
I'm digging the hell out of the AH-64D Module that was released in in the middle of March, 2022. I am also desperate to get my streamdeck back up and running after a major hard drive failure and loss (and, thankfully, subsequent if delayed recovery) of a lot of my DCS projects that I've tinkered with.

While the initial release will be the ExportModule for the Apache, as soon as I can dredge up the file for the Mi-24P (which was the first ExportModule I wrote), I'll be cleaning that up and uploading it here.
